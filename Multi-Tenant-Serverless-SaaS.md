# Multi-Tenant Applications Using AWS Serverless Technologies

## 1. The Evolution of Software Delivery: From Traditional to SaaS

Imagine a growing city with increasing housing demands. Initially, people built individual houses (traditional on-premises software), requiring significant investment in land, construction, and maintenance. As the population grew, apartment buildings emerged as a more efficient solution.

### The Salesforce Revolution

In the software world, Salesforce pioneered this transformation in 1999. Before Salesforce, companies needed to:
- Purchase expensive hardware
- Install complex CRM software
- Hire IT teams for maintenance
- Handle upgrades and patches themselves

Salesforce's innovation was delivering CRM as a service over the internet. Just like moving from owning a house to renting an apartment, companies could now:
- Access software via a browser
- Pay monthly fees instead of large upfront costs
- Receive automatic updates
- Scale usage up or down as needed

This revolutionary approach became known as Software as a Service (SaaS).

## 2. The Service Model Evolution

### The Apartment Building Analogy

Let's understand the evolution of cloud service models using our apartment building analogy:

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- *In our apartment building*: You rent a bare apartment with basic utilities connected.
- *In cloud computing*: You get virtual servers, storage, and networking.
- *Your responsibility*: Everything from the operating system up.
- *Examples*: AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- *In our apartment building*: You rent a fully furnished apartment with basic amenities.
- *In cloud computing*: You get a pre-configured platform to build applications.
- *Your responsibility*: Just your application code and data.
- *Examples*: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- *In our apartment building*: You rent a fully managed serviced apartment with everything included.
- *In cloud computing*: You use ready-made applications over the internet.
- *Your responsibility*: Just your data and how you use the application.
- *Examples*: Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, MISA (accounting software widely used in Vietnam), Base.vn (HR management platform in Vietnam), KiotViet (retail management system popular in Vietnam), VNPay (payment services), ezCloud (hotel management system in Vietnam).

## 3. SaaS: Definition and Two Faces

### Definition

SaaS is a software delivery model where applications are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis. It's like our apartment building where multiple tenants share a common infrastructure but have their private spaces.

### The Two Faces of SaaS

SaaS offers significant benefits while presenting notable challenges for organizations. On one hand, it eliminates upfront investments and IT burdens through subscription-based access, automatic updates, and anywhere accessibility. The model enables rapid deployment and seamless scaling while ensuring continuous improvement.

However, adopting SaaS means accepting reduced control over features, potential security vulnerabilities, and internet dependency. Organizations may face higher long-term costs than one-time purchases, limited customization options, and difficulties when switching providers. Additionally, regulated industries often encounter compliance obstacles, while performance remains subject to connection quality.

### Key SaaS Concepts

### Tenant

In our apartment building, each **tenant** is a family or individual who rents and occupies a unit. They sign a lease agreement, get their own keys, and have their own private living space.

In SaaS, a tenant is any customer organization that subscribes to your software service. Just as apartment residents have their own private space yet share common infrastructure, SaaS tenants have their own data and users while sharing the underlying application. When the building undergoes renovations, all tenants benefit simultaneously—similarly, when you update your SaaS application, all customers receive improvements at once.

### Tenant Isolation

In our apartment building, **tenant isolation** is achieved through locks on individual apartment doors, separate mailboxes, and distinct utility billing. Each resident can access only their own apartment, not their neighbors'.

In SaaS, tenant isolation ensures that each customer's data and processes remain strictly separate and inaccessible to other customers. This is implemented through security controls and data partitioning techniques. Without proper isolation, it would be like having apartment doors without locks—a serious breach of privacy and security that could destroy trust in your building management.

### Noisy Neighbor

The **noisy neighbor** in our apartment building is the resident who plays loud music at 2 AM or hosts frequent parties, degrading the living experience for other residents by consuming shared resources (quiet time, elevator capacity, parking spaces).

In SaaS, a noisy neighbor is a tenant whose excessive usage of system resources impacts the performance experienced by other tenants. For example, if one customer runs extremely complex database queries, it might slow down the system for everyone else. Managing noisy neighbors in SaaS requires implementing throttling, quotas, and resource allocation strategies—just as apartment buildings establish quiet hours, limit guests, or allocate specific parking spaces.

### Tenant Tiers

**Tenant tiers** in our apartment building are represented by different apartment types: studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and luxury penthouse options. Each comes with different amenities, space, and price points to serve different resident needs.

In SaaS, tenant tiers allow you to offer different service levels, features, and pricing to different market segments. A basic tier might have limited features with lower performance guarantees, while premium tiers offer enhanced functionality, higher request limits, and priority support. Each tier provides appropriate value for different customer needs and willingness to pay—just like different apartment offerings in a building.

### Multi-Tenant Architectural Models

#### Silo Model

In our apartment building analogy, the **silo model** is like having separate buildings for each tenant family, all managed by the same property company. Each building has its own foundation, utilities, security systems, and maintenance crew, but follows the same design standards and management protocols.

In SaaS, the silo model provides each tenant with completely dedicated resources - separate databases, application servers, and sometimes even entire AWS accounts. This offers maximum isolation but at higher cost and operational complexity. It's ideal for enterprise customers with strict regulatory requirements or those willing to pay premium prices for guaranteed resource allocation.

#### Pool Model

The **pool model** in our apartment building analogy is like a traditional apartment complex where all tenants share the same building structure, common areas, utilities, and maintenance staff. Each tenant has their private apartment, but the building infrastructure itself is shared.

In SaaS, this translates to tenants sharing the same database instances, compute resources, and application services, with logical separation implemented through tenant IDs or partitioning keys. This approach maximizes resource efficiency and simplifies operations but requires careful design to maintain security boundaries and prevent noisy neighbor problems. It's ideal for standard B2B or B2C scenarios with many similar tenants.

#### Bridge Model

The **bridge model** in our apartment analogy is like a hybrid condominium complex with both shared facilities and some dedicated amenities for premium residents. Perhaps all residents share the same building, but premium tenants get dedicated parking spots, private gyms, or concierge services.

In SaaS, this model combines elements of both silo and pool approaches. Certain components (like the authentication system or admin APIs) might be shared across all tenants for efficiency, while other components (like databases or compute resources) might be dedicated for premium tiers or tenants with special requirements. This balanced approach offers flexibility but does add architectural complexity.

### Data Partitioning

**Data partitioning** in our apartment building is how storage spaces are organized. There might be individual storage units in the basement (silo model), or shared storage areas with assigned shelves for each resident (pool model).

In SaaS, data partitioning refers to how tenant data is organized in databases and storage systems. You might give each tenant their own database (like individual storage units) or use a shared database with mechanisms to separate each tenant's data (like labeled shelves in a common storage room). The approach you choose impacts security, performance, resource efficiency, and operational complexity.

### Tenant Onboarding

**Tenant onboarding** in our apartment building is the process new residents go through: signing lease agreements, receiving keys, getting oriented to amenities, and setting up utilities. A smooth move-in experience is critical for resident satisfaction.

In SaaS, onboarding is how new customers are provisioned and set up to use your service. This includes account creation, initial configuration, data migration, and user training. A frictionless onboarding process is essential for customer retention and satisfaction. Serverless architectures excel here by enabling automated, scalable provisioning of resources for each new tenant.

### Tenant-Aware Operations

**Tenant-aware operations** in our apartment building means the management team knows exactly which resident reported a leaking faucet, which units need routine maintenance, and how to bill each apartment for individual utilities usage.

In SaaS, tenant-aware operations ensure that monitoring, alerts, logging, and other operational tools maintain context about which tenant is affected. When an issue occurs, you need to know immediately which customers are impacted and how severely. Serverless systems automatically include tenant context in logs, metrics, and tracing, making operational management much more effective.

## 4. AWS SaaS Lens Scenarios: Six Implementation Patterns

AWS offers diverse architectural approaches for building multi-tenant SaaS applications, each optimized for different requirements:

- **Serverless SaaS:** Leverages AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, DynamoDB, and EventBridge to create a fully managed, event-driven architecture. Functions execute with tenant context, while DynamoDB uses partition keys for data isolation. This approach eliminates infrastructure management, provides automatic scaling, and enables precise per-tenant cost attribution through AWS tagging.

- **Amazon EKS SaaS:** Builds on Kubernetes orchestration using EKS, isolating tenants through namespaces and RBAC. Implements service meshes like App Mesh for traffic control, with sidecars handling tenant context propagation. This pattern offers more control than serverless while maintaining isolation, supporting complex microservices with standardized deployment across environments.

- **Full Stack Isolation:** Deploys complete infrastructure stacks per tenant using separate AWS accounts within Organizations. CloudFormation or CDK creates identical environments, with Transit Gateway connecting isolated VPCs when needed. Systems Manager enables unified management across accounts, while CloudWatch provides centralized monitoring. Ideal for high-compliance scenarios requiring maximum tenant separation.

- **Hybrid SaaS Deployment:** Combines multi-tenant services for standard tiers with dedicated resources for premium offerings. Unified management interfaces backed by API Gateway or Application Load Balancers route traffic appropriately, with Step Functions orchestrating provisioning. This model balances resource efficiency with premium isolation options, creating tailored experiences based on customer tier.

- **Multi-tenant Microservices:** Implements microservices that independently choose appropriate tenancy models. AWS Cloud Map handles service discovery with tenant context, while SQS/SNS manage asynchronous communication. CodePipeline enables tenant-aware deployments, and API Gateway propagates tenant context between services. This pattern allows mixing pool and silo approaches based on each service's specific requirements.

- **Tenant Insights:** Delivers comprehensive tenant observability using CloudWatch metrics and logs with tenant dimensions, X-Ray for distributed tracing, and QuickSight for tenant-specific analytics. Cost Explorer with tenant tagging provides usage visibility, while CloudWatch Alarms set tenant-specific thresholds. This enables proactive issue detection, data-driven development, and resource optimization at the tenant level.
